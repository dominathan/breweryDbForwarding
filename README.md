# FREE-CORS-SERVER

Tired of dealing with CORS problems from the browser with no server? Fret no more, go to
`https://free-cors-server.herokuapp.com/any-request/{your-url}`

Ideally, you should `encodeURIComponent(your-url)`, but in any case it should send you back your object in the format it is returned to me.

Happy Coding!
